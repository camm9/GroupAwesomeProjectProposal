CSIS 3275 - Project Proposal
Purpose and Intent
The purpose of this project is to provide you with a real-world experience of working in a software team.
Students will be applying the knowledge gained in software engineering including various methodologies and
tools to their project. The instructor is the Product Manager, the boss. Every student will be required to work
on their project and contribute working code and one user story each sprint, project artifacts, documentation
software tests, blackbox tests etc. Participating in the programming and documentation tasks will help
students study for exams it is to the students benefit to participate as much as you can.
Project Participation Requirements
As a requirement of this course students must all engage in the class project and use the Git and GitHub tools
to contribute and communicate project progress and participation. As a student you are required to
contribute one working user story per sprint.
Students found not contributing a working user story to the project will be given
a ZERO mark for the sprint, furthermore the group respective **group will have
marks deducted from their over-all total for the user story(ies) that are
missing**
It is my full intention that the project in this class will simulate industry. Students may also under extenuating
circumstances be terminated from their group after due process (that means meeting minutes and paper
work). Please pick your groups carefully.
Project Proposal
This proposal is part of the group term project. Students will self-organize to form groups of 3 - 4 (preferably
3) people to complete the project in this course.
Students will pick a substantial project to work on and collaborate on. All projects will use the Springboot
framework. Common projects with solutions readily available on the internet will not be allowed. Some
common projects that are not allowed include the following:
Commonly available projects readily available on the web: Student Registration System, Library System
Simple Utilities
Projects that only require interact with a single user
Your project should have:
Attempt to solve a real-world problem
Web based (You are not limited in the front-end technology that you choose)
Project Proposal - F20.md 2023-09-26
2 / 6
Controller and Model Logic written in Java and use Springboot.
Multiple Users - The system must support multiple users
Integrate with two of the following: Web Service, File System, IoT device.
If a group fails to pick a substantial project they will have one assigned to them by the instructor.
Project Considerations
The project should address the needs of an organization, though it may be influenced by your
experience.
Be specific about the opportunity you are pursing (think problem/solution).
The size and scope of the project should fit one term and the number of members in your group. You
will need to impement it, not just design it (there will be lots of programming, testing etc.), Please keep
in mind that there are a number of surrounding activities that you will be doing with regards to the
project, this is not a coding exercise, it is an engineering one.
You will be implementing the core of your project in Java, this means that your business objects
and logic must be implemented in using Springboot.
Your project needs to have at least as many entities (realworld represented objects) as members on
your team that will be defined in this software. Each team member will be responsible for at least one
entity object.
You must interact with at least two external components to the Java runtime environment such as the
file system, web service etc, IOT.
You are permitted to use any existing third party components and plugins freely provided they are cited
and their licensing is properly adhered to.
Please keep in mind you will have to substantiate your choices so please be mindful of why you are cho
osing any third-party libraries, extensions or APIs.
Your instructor is not your technical support for this project (only for the labs). Part of software
engineering in teams is learning how to properly asses how long tasks will take you so you should take
that into consideration.
Project Schedule
The following is an example of Sprint 1 for a fictitious group, groups must assign one new user story to each
group member per sprint. Please keep in mind that user stories are general things users can do so granularity
is important. Simple CRUD operations for example are to small to be considered user stories however
"Manage" would suffice for all CRUD operations as a user story. A good example of a user story might be
"Setup and Configure User notifications". A total of 10 points must be distributed among all the user stories
for each sprint, more complex and involved user stories should have more points than simpler ones. Your
instructor reserves the right to adjust the points distribution.. You must provide the schedule for 3 sprints.
Sprint 1 (Example ONLY)

This is one of the most important parts of the project, pay close attention to the
sprint schedule and plan as best you can.
Sprint # Story Team Member Points
1 Customer Registration Llydia Batiz 2
1 Login Paul Eng 2
1 Manage Customer Profile Sam Hill 3
1 Password Reset John Patmos 3
Each Sprint must total 10 points to be distributed across team members. Each group member must be
assigned at least one story.
Evaluation of Sprints.
You will be showing your work on a lab computer personal computer to your instructor. All stories for a sprint
must be demonstrated on a single computer which contains a copy of your git repository.
Working in Groups
Student Requirements for Each Sprint
Each student in the group must integrate their own user story, one new user story for each sprint. Students
that do not submit a working user story for their project will receive a mark of ZERO for the entire sprint
regardless of the overall progress of the group. In addition the group will not be able to receive full marks for
the sprint (the total will be minus the missing user stories).
Group participation and Group member termination
Groups can terminate students from their groups for lack of capability, competency or capacity. Students can
only be terminated from a group if the following conditions are met:
This can only be done before the first sprint.
The remaining group members are agree that the student(s) should be terminated.
The appropriate case for terminating the student has been documented in meeting minutes, on Github
etc.
There is appropriate documentation that the group members have tried to communicate with members
being considered for termination using the agreed upon methods of communication for the group,
evidence must be provided that communication has taken place and those offending group members
have been given ample time to respond.
The Group Termination form must be filled out and submitted prior to the due date of the sprint. The
group must have tried to make contact with the group member on several occations using several
types of media across several days.

If a student is terminated from a group there two options are: 1) Propose a new
project for them to work on their own 2) Apply to work in another group. Groups
taking on previously terminated students must adjust their schedule to add
additional user stories according to the number of members that have joined the
group.
Students can transfer out of their group.
If a student transfer a group they must have a group to join. The following conditions must be met if a
student decides to quit:
* Students may only transfer during the first sprint
* Students must have a group to join prior to quitting their current group. Or
they will receive a ZERO mark for the first Sprint.
* The transfer form must be filled out and submitted before the first sprint is
due.
* The transfer form must be filled out by the receiving group team leader with the
appropriate information and sent via Blackboard messaging to the instructor.

Section Notes Marks
User
Stories
Outline your Initiative for each Sprint User Stories for the first three sprints, be
mindful of the granularity, these should represent more stories or stories of
software than tasks that a user performs for example. Write a simple use case where
a user story is described of the software this should have multiple steps and
represent a workflow. Be mindful of the right granularity, user stories should involve
multiple actors (types of users). This is the most important aspect of the entire
proposal https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics-storiesthemes You can see that user stories have a definition of Done., outline of subtasks
and tasks, have User personas, ordered steps and a time estimation in hours (this is
a must as well, record how much time you think each story will take)

Marks
Software
Toolset
What languages, tools, platforms, data sources, version control and bug-tracking
software will you be using? How will these help to capture your metrics?

Project
Schedule
Project schedule is articulated in time boxes of 2 weeks (also called sprints or
sprints, see page 78). Refer to the section above on "Project Schedule" You will
be required to produce working code showing that the use cases have been
implemented and run. Be sure that you have grouped the user stories by sprint and
distributed the points properly
7
Marks
Meeting
Minutes
Meeting minutes as an appendix from your group meeting including who attended,
when the meeting was held, how long it went for and a summary of the action
items for each group including the roles in your group project. You should always
take minutes so that you have a clear understanding of what needs to be done,
who was present and what tasks people were assigned. Your tasks should also be
added to your Kanban Board (refer to assignment #2). (starting from your first
sprint).
